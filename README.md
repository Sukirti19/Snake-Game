# Snake-Game
In our childhood, nearly all of us enjoyed playing classic snake games.
The Ideas from Java Swing are used to create this application. The application should comprise the following functionalities:

1. The Snake will have the ability to move in all four directions.
2. The snakeâ€™s length grows as it eats food.
3. When the snake crosses itself or strikes the perimeter of the box, the game is marked over.
4. Food is always given at different positions.
